# hello-world
Hopeful Flatiron Student
My name is Joshua Dror I am 30 years in the midst of a major career change.
I have been a licensed life and health Innsurance Agent for 9 years now, had some success and a few downfalls.
most recently Ive been managing a team of 16 agents who marketed and sold health insurance plans in all states through the Affordable Care act exchanges and many other avenues.
needless to say the the controversy of the Affordable act, and changes being made does not bode well for me or my bussiness.
After having a down year this year I am realizing the need to change career paths and focus on a career path where I can provide a needed skill for years to come and one that I find fulfiiling both mentally and monetarily.
I have always been curios about the details and sheer ingenuity behind software and the coding skills needed to make minor changes whether it be in a a software program, or a basic website, and I think there is no better time to start learning this new language than the present.
